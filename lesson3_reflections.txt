1.When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to share my proj with some other people or to work on it from various machines 


2.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Manual pull gives control and consistensy, because logical changes may include several local commits.


3.Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is a copy of remote repository that stores onto GitHub. Clone is local copy of remote. Branch is a tip placed on the head of chain of commits, that allows to access these commits.  


4.What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Sync with remote branch state

Git and GitHub are the special tools created for collaborating and team work. So is't abviously work without Git and GitHub would be much harder.
