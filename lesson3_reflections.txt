1.When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to share my proj with some other people or to work on it from various machines 


2.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Manual pull gives control and consistensy, because logical changes may include several local commits.
